<!--
This is the "_ViewImports.cshtml" file, which is used to import namespaces and tag helpers that will be available to all Razor views in the application:

1. Fag_el_Gamous: The main namespace for the application.
2. Fag_el_Gamous.Models: Contains the application's data models.
3. Fag_el_Gamous.Models.ViewModels: Contains the view models used for passing data between the controller and views.
4. Fag_el_Gamous.Models.UserModels: Contains the user-related models for authentication and authorization purposes.

Additionally, the code adds two sets of tag helpers:

1. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers: A collection of tag helpers provided by ASP.NET Core for use in views. These tag helpers simplify the creation of HTML elements and offer integration with server-side code.
2. Fag_el-Gamous: A collection of custom tag helpers specific to the Fag el-Gamous application, enabling the creation of reusable and maintainable UI components.

By placing these imports and tag helpers in the "_ViewImports.cshtml" file, they are automatically available to all Razor views in the project, reducing the need for redundant import statements and making the code more maintainable.
