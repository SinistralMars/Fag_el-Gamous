<!--
This is the "_ViewStart.cshtml" file, which is used to define common settings that apply to all Razor views in the application.

In this file, the Layout property is set to "_Layout", which specifies that the "_Layout.cshtml" file should be used as the 
default layout for all views. The layout file contains the common HTML structure and elements that should be rendered on every page, 
such as the header, footer, and navigation menu.

By setting the Layout property in the "_ViewStart.cshtml" file, it becomes the default layout for all views in the project. 
This eliminates the need to set the layout explicitly in each view, making the code more maintainable and consistent.
