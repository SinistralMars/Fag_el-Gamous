<!--
This code includes two JavaScript libraries:

1. jQuery Validation: A plugin that provides client-side validation for form inputs, ensuring the entered data adheres to specified 
rules before submission.

2. jQuery Validation Unobtrusive: An extension to the jQuery Validation plugin that adds support for ASP.NET Core's data annotation 
attributes, enabling seamless integration of client-side validation with server-side model validation.

These libraries work together to enhance user experience by providing immediate feedback on form input validation, reducing the need 
for round trips to the server for validation purposes.
