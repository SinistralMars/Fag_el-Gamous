<!-- 
This Razor view is used to display an error page whenever an error occurs while processing a user's request in the 
Fag el-Gamous web application. It displays a generic error message and, if available, the Request ID associated with 
the error. In addition, the view provides guidance for enabling the Development environment to obtain more detailed error 
information during local debugging. It also warns against enabling the Development environment in deployed applications as 
it may expose sensitive information to end users.

@model ErrorViewModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Error";
}

<h1 class="text-danger">Error.</h1>
<h2 class="text-danger">An error occurred while processing your request.</h2>

@if (Model.ShowRequestId)
{
    <p>
        <strong>Request ID:</strong> <code>@Model.RequestId</code>
    </p>
}

<h3>Development Mode</h3>
<p>
    Swapping to <strong>Development</strong> environment will display more detailed information about the error that occurred.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Development environment shouldn't be enabled for deployed applications.</strong>
    It can result in displaying sensitive information from exceptions to end users.
    For local debugging, enable the <strong>Development</strong> environment by setting the <strong>ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT</strong> environment variable to <strong>Development</strong>
    and restarting the app.
